# Binary Tree w/ Stack Implementation
Implements and sorts and binary tree in C/C++ using structures. 

Also implemented my own stack to walk through and access the values of the tree
to provide more control, and prevent from a stack overflow on the program using
recursion

# How-To
Just need to compile this code on your own machine to see how it works!

Run this command

$ gcc btStack.cpp â€“o btStack_out
